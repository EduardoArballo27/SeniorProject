# What is a DigiSpark?

A DigiSpark is an arduino board meant to run a script disguised as a keyboard typing

# Student Sample

The Student Sample is a harmless version of the DigiSpark that is meant to be passed around as a small demonstration to the students of the class

# Presentation Sample

The Presentation Sample is the version of the DigiSpark that is meant to be used for the presentation only. It is written in a specific way so it will not work with school computers, but is also not recommended to be put into a school computer, as to avoid possibly damaging it.

<b> What Does It Do? </b>

This code is supposed to create a new account under the name Henry with the password Pass_123 on a computer that is given Admin Access and is also given Remote Desktop Access, meaning it can control a computer from a different computer. This is also known as a backdoor access. The account is then hidden from the loggin page in order to keep owner of the device from knowing about it.

# What Does This Mean For School Computers?

Pretty much nothing, as explained above, the attack cannot be used on school computers. The code relies on the use of task manager and Command Prompt in order to run, both which are blocked from being used by students.

# Can A DigiSpark Be Blocked In The First Place?

It's hard to say. Since the DigiSpark disguises itself as keyboard, and blocking a keyboard from typing is not really a good idea since it is needed to type. The best way to keep an attach like this from happening is to simply lock the computer. In order for the DigiSpark to work, a computer needs to be logged in. Without the computer being logged in, the DigiSpark is defeated.

# Of Course, The Warnings

I hate to be the type of person who does this but, I need to be able to cover for myself.

<b>
  MISUSE OF THIS CODE AND MISUSE OF THE DIGISPARK CAN LEAD TO DAMAGING A COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICES. TRYING TO EXECUTE THIS CODE WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING PUTS YOUR DEVICE IN DANGER. THESE ARE ONLY EXAMPLES AND ARE NOT PROPERLY MADE FOR BEING USED AS A RELIABLE TOOL. THEY ARE MEANT FOR DEMONSTRATIONS ONLY AND NOT TO BE USED FOR CAUSING HARM TO A COMPUTER OR DEVICE THAT DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUES THAT OCCUR FROM ATTEMPTING TO REPLICATE MY DEMONSTRATIONS.
